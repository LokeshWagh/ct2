      description: "The Guernsey cattle breed originated in the Channel Islands between France and England.",
      details:'The Guernsey cattle breed originated in the Channel Islands between France and England and was named for the Isle of Guernsey, which is the westernmost of the group. (The Jersey breed was developed on the neighboring island of Jersey, and the two breeds are related.) Cattle were first brought to Guernsey from Brittany over 1,000 years ago. Subsequent imports brought cattle from Normandy and this founding population was variable in size and in color, including white, red, black, brindle, and fawn. Over the next several centuries, cattle on the island were selected for the richness and quantity of their milk, and performance was gradually improved. Channel Islands cattle were exported to England beginning in the 1700s where they were widely used in the establishment and improvement of other breeds.There was extensive trade between the Channel Islands and England, France, and the Netherlands, and cattle were part of this trade until the early 1800s. At that time, imports into Guernsey were stopped and the island herds were closed. Since then, the export of breeding stock from the islands has been a major agricultural enterprise. The closing of the island herds encouraged the standardization of the islands’ breeds. Cattle shows, which began in 1828 on Guernsey, hastened the process. Guernsey breeders selected their cattle for consistency of color, ranging from fawn to golden, with white spotting and golden skin. Guernsey cattle were first imported to North America in the 1830s, with importations peaking in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Guernsey Cattle Club was formed in 1877. The breed became a significant genetic foundation for the American dairy industry, contributing to the general mix of dairy cattle, as well as being used as a purebred.'
